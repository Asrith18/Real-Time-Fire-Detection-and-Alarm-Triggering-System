# FIRE_DETECTION
ITS A FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM USING IMAGE PROCESSING
First we need to setup the python extensinon in the vscode platform.
This repository contains a real-time fire detection alarm system designed to detect fire hazards using sensor data and trigger an alert to notify users instantly. The system uses image recognition (or sensor data, depending on your design) to monitor environments for potential fire outbreaks, helping to ensure safety and early warning in case of emergencies.
Software:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (for image processing, if using a camera)
Flask/Django (if building a web interface)
Twilio or similar service (for SMS alerts)
MQTT or similar protocol (for real-time data transmission)
And after that we need to add the Json path and then we add fire detection cascade functin model.

After run on the cmd file we will add an email link in the previous python code if suppose if any fire detection happens means it makes sound as like alaram and also show that video link in the certain linked mail given by the user.
